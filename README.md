# US 2024 Domestic Aviation Forecasting

This project analyzes and forecasts monthly passenger trends for domestic US air travel in 2024 using time series modeling with Prophet. The objective is to generate predictive insights for October to December 2024 and evaluate model performance against real-world data.

## 📊 Key Features

- Time series forecasting using Facebook Prophet
- Hoverable, interactive visualizations with Plotly
- Evaluation of forecast accuracy (MAE, RMSE, MAPE)
- Month-wise comparison of actual vs predicted passengers

## 📁 Project Structure

- `US-2024Domestic-Aviation-Prediction.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook with full workflow
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies
- `.gitignore`: Standard ignore rules

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Launch the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook US-2024Domestic-Aviation-Prediction.ipynb
   ```

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Includes a backtest-based forecast comparison for Oct–Dec 2024 using known actuals and standard error metrics like MAE, RMSE, and MAPE.
